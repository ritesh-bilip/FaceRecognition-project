Face Recognition Project

 Welcome to the Face Recognition Project! This project leverages the power of OpenCV and the 
 face_recognition library to detect and recognize faces in real-time. ðŸŽ¥âœ¨

ðŸš€ Features:
  Real-time Face Detection: Utilizes your camera feed to detect faces on the go.
  Efficient Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a database of known faces.
  Easily Customizable: Add or remove faces from the known database with ease.
ðŸ“ˆ Usage:
 Real-time Monitoring: Keep the camera feed open to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
 Face Recognition: The script identifies known faces and labels them appropriately.

ðŸ’¡ Inspiration:
 Develop a home security system with face recognition.
 Use it for attendance systems in educational institutions or workplaces.
